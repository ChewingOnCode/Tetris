        <h2>How to "Tetris"</h2>
        <h3>A Brief History of Tetris</h3>
        <p class="heading">Gameplay</p>
        <p>Tetris is a game in which the player controls a shape that moves across the screen. The shape can rotate and
            move left and right. They are called "Tetriminos". They fall from the top of the screen where the player
            moves them latterally until they reach the bottom of the grid or touch another tetrimino. The object of the
            game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal rows as possible. When a line is "completed", it
            disappears, and the blocks that are placed above fall one rank. Also, completing lines grants points.
            Accumulating a certain number of points moves the player to the next level which in turn increases the
            points per line.
        </p>
        <p class="heading">Tetriminos</p>
        <p>The pieces in which the game of tetris is based around are called "Tetriminos". Pajitnov's original version
            for the Elektronika 60 computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up the tetriminos.
            Versions of tetris on the original Game Boy / Game Boy Color and the most dedicated handheld games use
            monochrome or grayscale graphics. However, the most popular use a separate color for each distinct shape.
            Prior to the Tetris Company's standardizations in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from
            implementation to implementation.
        </p>
        <p class="heading">Scoring</p>
        <p>Scoring is based on the number of rows cleared. The higher the number of rows cleared, the more points should
            be awarded. Example, if 1 rows is cleared, the player should receive 100 points. Whereas, 4 lines at once
            known as a "Tetris" are valued at 800 points, and each subsuquent line is worth 1,200 points. In
            conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which require multiple line clears in
            quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering a combos as well as the amount of importance assigned
            to them, vary from game to game.

            Nearly, all the tetris games allow the user to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's
            descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a "soft drop" and a "hard drop"
            respectively. While performing a "soft drop", the player can slow the descent of the piece by releasing the
            button before the piece settles into place. Many games award more points by using the hard drop.

        <p class="heading">How To Play</p>
        <p>Start a new game by pressing the <strong>Start Game</strong>button. Tetriminos will begin falling from the
            top of the grid and pile up at the bottom. You, the player, must rotate the tetriminos, to best fit together
            and complete lines across the width of the grid. Each successful clear will result in the line being removed
            from the grid and awarded <strong>15</strong> points. For every <strong>5</strong> lines cleared you will
            gain a level. The game continues until the Tetriminos reach the top of the grid at which point the game is
            over.
